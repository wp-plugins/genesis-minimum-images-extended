== Description ==

Allows for changing the "banner" image in Minimum 2.0 posts to not be the featured image. There are times you won't want the banner image for a post to be the featured image due to aspect ratios or simply wanting them to be different images for the blog index, homepage thumbnails, Facebook, Pinterest, etc.

This is intended for the child theme Minimum 2.0 for the Genesis framework. We plan on expanding the child themes and functionality as it evolves and StudioPress releases more themes that use featured images to enhance the design but where developers and users may want extended options.

== Installation ==

1. Upload contents of the directory to /wp-content/plugins/ (or use the automatic installer)
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. In any post or page, upload an image in the new Minimum Image metabox.
1. Verify it works!
